(You can find these functions in dvd_rental database.)

Why does ‘rewards_report’ function return 0 rows? Correct and recreate the function, so that it's able to return rows properly.
Is there any function that can potentially be removed from the dvd_rental codebase? If so, which one and why?
* The ‘get_customer_balance’ function describes the business requirements for calculating the client balance. Unfortunately, not all of them are implemented in this function. Try to change function using the requirements from the comments.
* How do ‘group_concat’ and ‘_group_concat’ functions work? (database creation script might help) Where are they used?
* What does ‘last_updated’ function do? Where is it used?
* What is tmpSQL variable for in ‘rewards_report’ function? Can this function be recreated without EXECUTE statement and dynamic SQL? Why?
